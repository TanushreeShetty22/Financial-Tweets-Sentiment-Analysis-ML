Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing serves as the foundational step in any analysis endeavor. In this phase, we meticulously transformed raw data into a structured format conducive to machine learning analysis. Key preprocessing steps included:
•	Binary Sentiment Labeling: By transforming sentiment labels into binary variables, we established a standardized framework for sentiment analysis. This step facilitates model interpretation and ensures consistency across the dataset.
•	Text Data Cleaning: Leveraging natural language processing techniques, we cleaned tweet text data to remove noise and enhance readability. Non-alphabetic characters were removed, text was converted to lowercase, and stopwords were filtered out. This process culminated in a refined dataset ready for analysis.
•	Tweet Length Derivation: The derivation of tweet lengths offered valuable insights into the distribution and complexity of sentiment-bearing text. Understanding tweet length dynamics aids in contextualizing sentiment analysis results and identifying potential correlations between text length and sentiment intensity.

Model Training and Evaluation
Three machine learning models were trained and rigorously evaluated using established performance metrics:
•	Logistic Regression: Known for its simplicity and interpretability, logistic regression exhibited strong performance with an accuracy of 85.3%. This model serves as a baseline for comparison against more complex methodologies.
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Despite its simplicity, KNN demonstrated respectable performance with an accuracy of 82.4%. This algorithm is well-suited for text classification tasks and provided competitive results within our framework.
•	Decision Tree: As a tree-based model, decision trees offer a clear decision-making process. However, in our analysis, decision trees exhibited slightly lower performance with an accuracy of 74.2%. Further optimization may be warranted to unlock the full potential of this methodology.
